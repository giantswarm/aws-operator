# aws-operator

The aws-operator manages Kubernetes clusters running on AWS.

### How to build

Build the standard way.

```
go build github.com/giantswarm/aws-operator
```

## Architecture

The operator uses our [operatorkit][1] framework. It manages an `awsconfig`
CRD using a generated client stored in our [apiextensions][2] repo. Releases
are versioned using [version bundles][3].

The operator provisions guest Kubernetes clusters running on AWS. It runs in a
host Kubernetes cluster also running on AWS.

### CloudFormation

The guest Kubernetes clusters are provisioned using [AWS CloudFormation][4]. The
resources are split between 3 CloudFormation stacks.

* guest-main manages the guest cluster resources.
* host-setup manages an IAM role used for VPC peering.
* host-main manages network routes for the VPC peering connection.

The host cluster may run in a separate AWS account. If so resources are created
in both the host and guest AWS accounts.

### Other AWS Resources

As well as the CloudFormation stacks we also provision a KMS key and S3 bucket
per cluster. This is to upload cloudconfigs for the cluster nodes. The
cloudconfigs contain TLS certificates which are encrypted using the KMS key.

### Kubernetes Resources

The operator also creates a Kubernetes namespace per guest cluster with a
service and endpoints. These are used by the host cluster to access the guest
cluster.

### Certificates

Authentication for the cluster components and end-users uses TLS certificates.
These are provisioned using [Hashicorp Vault][5] and are managed by our
[cert-operator][6].

## Secret

Here the AWS IAM credentials have to be inserted.
```
service:
  aws:
    accesskey:
      id: 'TODO'
      secret: 'TODO'
```

Here the base64 representation of the data structure above has to be inserted.
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: aws-operator-secret
  namespace: giantswarm
type: Opaque
data:
  secret.yml: 'TODO'
```

To create the secret manually do this.
```
kubectl create -f ./path/to/secret.yml
```

We also need a key to hold the SSH public key

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: aws-operator-ssh-key-secret
  namespace: giantswarm
type: Opaque
data:
  id_rsa.pub: 'TODO'
```
