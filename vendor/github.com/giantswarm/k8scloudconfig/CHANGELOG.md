versions are frozen. To freeze current version all files are copied to a new
version directory, and  then changes are introduced.

## [v4.7.0] WIP

### Added

- Enable TTLAfterFinished feature gate. This allows a TTL controller to clean up jobs after they finish execution.

### Changed

- Update kubernetes to 1.14.6, includes fixes for CVE-2019-9512, CVE-2019-9514

## [v4.6.0]

### Added

- Systemd unit, which sets certificates group owner to `giantswarm`, so that cert-exporter running as user `giantswarm` is able to read certificates.

### Changed

- Mount relevant directories so that the command `docker` can run in `Kubelet`. This is needed for `rbd` to mount `Ceph` volumes on the nodes.
- Add explicit cgroups for finer grained resources management over operating system components and container runtime.

duration can be used in AWS China regions to mitigate slow image pulls.
