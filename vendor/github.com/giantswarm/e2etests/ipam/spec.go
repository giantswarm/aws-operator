	//
	//     - Create guest clusters #1, #2, #3.
	//     - Wait for guest clusters to be ready.
	//     - Verify that clusters have distinct subnets.
	//     - Terminate guest cluster #2 and immediately create guest cluster #4.
	//     - Wait for guest clusters to be deleted and created.
	//     - Verify that clusters have distinct subnets and created cluster #4 did
	//       not receive same subnet that deleted cluster #2 had.
	//     - Delete guest clusters.
