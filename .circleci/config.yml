# TODO the workflow is unnecessary complicated due to some deficiencies in our
# deployment pipeline as of time of writing. Therefore the push to Aliyun is
# kind of optional in pull requests so that it does not block the push to the
# app catalog. This is to have faster iterations when working on a daily basis.
# Nevertheless we want the image push to Aliyun to be finished before we want to
# push to the app catalog in case we merge to master or push a tag, which
# indicates a new release. This is to have a more reliable pipeline, with the
# caveat that it takes longer and sometimes even breaks. Once the situation got
# improved we can simplify the circle config again as modified in the pull
# request linked below.
