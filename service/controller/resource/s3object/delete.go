// Bucket. Note that we share the resource implementation to cover different
// Cloud Config objects, for instance for TCCP and TCNP stacks. These have
// different lifecycles which means we do not delete Cloud Config objects of a
// deleted Node Pool. Another very rare but noteworthy side effect might be that
// Node Pool IDs generate twice during the lifetime of a Tenant Cluster cause
// existing Cloud Config objects to be overwritten with newer versions,
// potentially causing confusion and inconsisencies upon inspection. Chances are
// you win the lotto before this bullshit ever happens, but one should
// understand current design decisions.
